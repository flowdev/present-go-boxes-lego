# Boxes Versus Lego Bricks in Go Programming

[![GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/assets/badge.svg)](https://gitpitch.com/flowdev/present-go-boxes-lego/master?grs=github&t=white)

In programming we usually build programms out of functions or methods that call
other functions or methods.
This is very much like building a house out of boxes.
Another approach is much more like building a house out of Lego bricks.
Some of the differences and an implementation in Go is shown.
